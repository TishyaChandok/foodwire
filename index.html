        <p>No more doubts! Hey all! Ever find yourself in a situation where you are stuck on a question and did not
            understand a certain topic, waiting for your next inline class
            to finally ask the teacher and finish the work! well, say goodbye to that, and start exploring SOLVEIFY now!
            Just select your school, write down your question and get your detailed answer from your teacher within 24
            hours.
            We are trying to make a direct contact between the students and the teachers for the teachers to refer to
            the doubts of every single student. If your question
            has already been answered, we will show you that explanation sent by the teacher itself.</p>
